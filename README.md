// Information added by me (Sampad Kumar Das)

1. Installation process : ng new project_name & then just accept the farther process (ex. choose styling -> scss - y)
2. Building application : ng build (inside dist folder one build version of the application will be created)
3. Run application locally : ng serve / ng s / ng s --o ('o' for opening the application directly in the default browser) / ng s --port 4300 (mentioning different port - by default port is 4200)
